In this Project: Understanding Polymorphism in Python
Overview
In this project, I focused on the concept of polymorphism in Python, which is a core principle of object-oriented programming. Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. This project covered various aspects of polymorphism, including duck typing, strong typing, method overloading, method overriding, and operator overloading.
Topics Covered
Concept of Polymorphism
Polymorphism in Python enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common super class. This allows for writing more generic and reusable code.
Duck Typing
Duck typing is a form of polymorphism where an object's suitability is determined by the presence of certain methods and properties rather than the actual type of the object. The name comes from the saying, "If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck." In Python, if an object implements the necessary methods, it can be used in place of another object.
Strong Typing
Strong typing refers to the enforcement of strict type constraints. In strongly typed languages, operations are allowed only on compatible types. Python, while dynamically typed, still enforces strong typing, meaning you cannot perform operations on incompatible types without explicit conversion.
Method Overloading
Method overloading is the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters in a class. However, Python does not natively support method overloading like some other languages (e.g., Java). Instead, default arguments and variable-length argument lists (*args and **kwargs) are used to achieve similar functionality.
Method Overriding
Method overriding allows a derived class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its base class. The overridden method in the derived class must have the same name and parameters as the method in the base class.
Operator Overloading
Operator overloading enables custom implementation of operators for user-defined classes. This is achieved by defining special methods in a class, such as __add__ for addition, __sub__ for subtraction, and so on. This allows objects of the class to use operators like +, -, *, and / in a meaningful way.
